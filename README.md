# Compressing Files With Huffman ðŸ“‚

[Project Description ðŸ§¾](https://github.com/Lina-Abureesh4/AlgorithmsProj2/blob/master/Project2_Huffman%2BCode.pdf)

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing Huffman Coding, a widely used lossless data compression algorithm. The goal is to efficiently compress and uncompress files by assigning variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies. Characters that occur more frequently are assigned shorter codes, while less frequent characters are given longer codes.

**The header of the compressed file contains**:
- File extension.
- Original fils size (bytes).
- Header size (bytes).
- Huffman coding tree structure (in post-order manner).

**The statistics table shows for each byte (0-255)**:
- ASCII value.
- Frequency.
- Huffman code.
- Length of the Huffman code.
